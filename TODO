TODO list for future after 3.3
------------------------------

FF1 
unify LTL(R) and QFLTL(R) commands
allow QFLTL(R) specifications with objective values

FF2
export_CTMC ?
export_Boolean ?

FF3
events for modifying not only parameters but also state variables (concentrations)

FF4
domains (alias trace_analyze) should return the domains of variables plus Time

FF5
use a predicate for warning and errors in the Prolog code
and put a section in the user's manual

FF6
provide facilities to express constraints on parameters

FF7
compute T-invariants, siphons and traps

FF8
allow negative values (and kinetics expression?) in present


TODO list for release 3.3
-------------------------

DONE FF-4 bug on show_parameters with Rosenbrock

FF-3 parameter(p,v) does not (always) change parameter

DONE FF-2 connection to NuSMV broken on Ubuntu !

DONE FF-1 export_sbml loops since events

FF1
bug Tyson 6 var with k2=0 and k5=0
for cmaes search parameters
(disappears when we suppress these parameters)

DONE FF2
Hill H(v,k,n)
should allow n to be a parameter or expression

FF3
cmaes search with oscil does not work

FF4
add invariants ne change pas show_ODE (show_kinetics)

FF5
pb ELisabetta avec load_ODE ? test load_ODE

DONE FF6
when making a release
we should not provide the source files of the documentation
only manual.pdf and manual.html with necessary images

FF7 
clean and add our examples
make sure they are in the distrib

DONE FF8 still bug with time events, events fixed for all numerical methods
time_events have been added to events
they are exported in Biocham by printing 
"event(C,PL,VL)" or time_event(T,C,PL,VL) not "add_event(C,PL,VL)"
for the [GUI] they are written add_time_event(T,C,PL,VL)

FF9
export_biocham could export numerical_simulation method with parameters and others ?

TODO list for release 3.1
-------------------------

FF1: bug reduction de modeles

avec EXAMPLES/kinetics/MM.bc

rmerge({S+E=>C, C=>P+E}).
list_rules.
rdelete(C=>S+E).
sdelete(C).
--> parse_error (S+E) 

FF2: DONE!

pas de message d'erreur sur ajout de molecule localisee
le parser (et la doc) ne devrait permettre de localiser que les objets molecules
pas les sous-molecules

biocham: add_rule(A::l=>B).
A::l=>B

biocham: add_rule((A::L)-B =>C).

biocham: list_rules.
A::l=>B.

-------

SS1:
====

Patterns <=> (resp. <=[_]=>) are actually equivalent to => (resp. =[_]=>)

*****
biocham: add_rule(a + b => c + d).
a+b=>c+d

biocham: list_rules(a + ? <=> ?).
a+b=>c+d

biocham: list_rules(? <=> a + ?).

biocham:
*****

Thus, the pattern <=> is neither the conjunction nor the disjunction of => and
<=

-> document it?

-> refuse bidirectional patterns...

-> remove all biocham patterns? ;)


SS2:
====

parameter(k, 1).
present(X, k).

-> should force k to be dimensionless in dimensional analysis.

SS3:
====

The new GUI does not open a file when a .bc file is double-clicked or when a
.bc file is dropped onto its icon.

SS4:
====

Keyboard shortcuts, especially classical ones (CTRL-W = close, CTRL-S = save,
CTRL-N = new...) and often used ones (numerical simulation for instance) are
missing or surprising...

export_sbml(file.bc)
The current biocham implementation already deals with species and parameter declarations and with reactions.
Macros must be added using the rule type AssignmentRule.  The left-hand side of an assignment rule can refer to the identifier of a species, compartment, or parameter.
The macro square_wave should be treated apart (frac is needed to encode it since a primitive for square waves in not present in sbml, or at least I didn't find it).
Events mut be added using eventAssignment. As for events related to time, the csymbol relative to time must be used.


export_ode(file.bc)
The current biocham implementation already deals with species and parameter declarations and with reactions.
Macros exportation is already implemented but the case of square waves should be dealt with.
Events should be added using global flags. I didn't find yet  how to encode time.

load_sbml(file.xml)
Events are already added but the ones concerning time must be treated yet.

load_ode(file.ode)
Events must be added.


Furthermore, cosinus and sinus must be added in export_sbml, export_ode, load_sbml, and load_ode.
