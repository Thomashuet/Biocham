The Biochemical Abstract Machine (BioCham) is a modelling environment for systems biology, with some unique features for inferring unknown model parameters from temporal logic constraints.

BioCham is mainly composed of :

    * a rule-based language for modeling biochemical systems (compatible with SBML)
    * several simulators (boolean, differential, stochastic),
    * a temporal logic based language to formalize the temporal properties of a biological system,
    * several features for developing/correcting/completing/coupling models, including the inference of kinetic parameters in high dimension from temporal logic constraints.

BioCham is a free software protected by the GNU General Public License GPL version 2. This is an Open Source license that allows free usage of this software.

Feedback on the use of BioCham in applications, research or teaching are particularly welcomed
on the developpers mailing list: biocham@inria.fr
