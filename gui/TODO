TODO list for release 3.3 (update October 4 2011)
-------------------------

FF-13
When you read a model with directives about the numerical method 
no step doubling etc. (e.g. ball.bc) it would be nice if the 
ODE simulator interface was initialized by default as specified 
in the file

FF-12a
In the menu Help the folder documentation should appear opened.
FF12-b
The pdf of only the manual is ugly :-(
perhaps a problem of fonts I will check with Sylvain
--> open manual.html instead of manual.pdf and we will have the links


FF-11
In the interface for the events of the models
replace "Kinetics" by "Values" (or "Expressions")

DJ IN PROGRESS(04.10.2011):
DONE-->1. F10a/b
DONE-->2. F09
DONE-->3. F08
DONE-->4. F07

DONE--> simulation progress window?
IN PROGRESS--> better rge?

IN PROGRESS-->5. biocham release documentation(linux/windows/mac)
IN PROGRESS-->6. gui testing documentation
7. fest tests 




FF-10a
In the graphical editor (which is quite nice !)
save layout should indicate the dot extension
and should take the dir of the model bc file as default.
-->IT WAS THE CASE. Except for the dot extension.
-->DONE!

FF-10b
However open layout is not implemented right ?
(for using a dot layout to draw the model in the graphical editor)
so currently the saved layout cannot be reused right ?
-->DONE.

FF-09
In the menu of abstractions
put the "draw" buttons first
-->DONE!


FF-08
seen on EXAMPLES/events/ball.bc
the parameter r is not shown but the menu says "deselect it" instead of "select it"
the CTRL CLICK does not work correctly 
and finishes by
 java.lang.NullPointerException
 at fr.inria.contraintes.biocham.BiochamLoggerThread.run(BiochamLoggerThread.java:260)
-->DONE.

FF-07
ODE simulation should have a widget for changing 
step_doubling whatever the simulation method is
plus 
no_step_doubling and step_size only for Runge-Kutta method
-->DONE!


FF-6
in gui/makefile.am some dependencies are missing
for instance gui/dialogs/*java gui/modelData/*java etc.
-->DONE.


DJ IN PROGRESS(12.09.2011):
DONE-->1. default time horizon for cmaes parameter search and any command
should be the same as for simulation
DONE-->2. mode debug, delete debug messages on the calling console
DONE-->3. tutorial
DONE-->4. finish code documentation
5. release documentation(linux/windows/mac)
6. testing documentation
7. fest tests 


FF-5 when quitting: class java.lang.NullPointerException,null
-->DONE.

FF-4
The default time unit for stochastic simulation should be the same as for ODE simulation.
--->VERY SLOW, CAN LAST FOR VERY LONG TIME, it blocks the user work with biocham until the simulation finishes.
--> the default value should be *20* as in the manual (for all simulations)

FF-3
The result of a simulation needs to click to get it fitted to screen
-->DONE.

FF-2
The window BiochamWarnings should contain only warnings and errors
or be empty (do not write BIOCHAM)
-->DONE.

FF-1
time_events have been added to events
they are exported in Biocham by printing 
"event(C,PL,VL)" or time_event(T,C,PL,VL) not "add_event(C,PL,VL)"
for communication with the [GUI] they are written add_time_event(T,C,PL,VL)
-->DONE.

DJ IN PROGRESS(26.05.2011):
IN PROGRESS->1.mode debug
DONE->2.conection eclipse-svn
DONE->3.documentation dans svn
DONE->4.simulators panel
DONE->5.abstraction panel
DONE->6.Simulators->Simulations
DONE->7.Command-lien ctrl+P, tabs and focus at the end of output
DONE->8.Input to bioham to be wrtitten at the cmdline output
DONE->9.When a plot is generated to open it in the corresponding view
DONE->10.Order of simulators(ode-stoch-bool)
DONE->11. separate each simulator
DONE->12. Popups for all the menu!

FF-1
For the menus both in the left window and in the top bar
use the following categories as in the manual:
- model
- simulators
- boolean temporal properties
- numerical temporal properties
- abstractions
-->DONE!

FF0
generate documentation using javadoc
-->DONE AUTOMATICALLY BY ECLIPSE!
add javadoc comments in your code to improve that documentation
-->IN PROGRESS!


FF1  
Two commands have been renamed
solve--> domains 
list_kinetics --> list_ODE
update your version with the svn version
-->DONE!


FF2 
the default time horizon for cmaes parameter search and any command
should be the same as for simulation
(currently it's 20 and 200)
-->IN PROGRESS!


FF3
one button for interrupting a command running would be welcomed
-->DONE!

FF4
the biocham warnings are not visible in the warning window (in my windows version)
they should
the warning window should keep trace of all warnings and errors messages
-->DONE! but, to check again, as it appears normally when I test it.

FF5
the command line window is still not working well with the cursor
the output has been improved but is still not perfect
can't you see it yourself ?
The best would be to have a single command line scrollable window
where you type commands and see the answers
-->DONE!

FF6 
if it is easy it would be nice that all the commands executed from the gui 
be printed in the command line window
the user will know that exactly what does a gui button
-->DONE!

FF7
I think it's not a good idea to automatically close a popup window like rule
when you return to the main rule menu
the popup windows should be closed by the user
If it is for a problem of consistency with the modifications 
it would be better to refresh the popup window rather than close it
-->DONE!

FF8
the popup windows should get the focus when click 
(FF8b simple click should be enough rather than double click)
does not work for macro popup when rule popup opened
-->DONE!

FF9
delete debug messages on the calling console
-->IN PROGRESS!At the end!!!!!

FF10
Add to svn the generated documentation of the gui code in Java
-->DONE!

TODO list for release 3.1
-------------------------

FF-1: bug graphical editor
C+(E+S) => C+(E+P) is not parsed correctly
creates (E S) and P) nodes
-->DONE

FF0: graphical editor
- it is very difficult to change the orientation of the rule boxes
- it is sometimes difficult to drag the right element
-->OK, I HOPE?

FF1: menu Rules
- should contain a button to call the graphical rule editor
-->TD

- "add" button should be "add rule" since only one rule is accepted
or entering several rules should be accepted
(the syntax error is unclear in that case)
-->IT IS POSSIBLE TO ADD MULTIPLE RULES

- a final . should be accepted after entering a rule
-->IT IS

- synthesis degradation make no sense ?
-->IT MAKES

FF2: the Help should give the version
that is defined in the environment using automake
-->Normally its to us to add when the executable are being made...

FF3: command line
the cursor should be on the new line after executiing the command
-->?

FF4: the manual in html and pdf should be available
and opened with the user's browser not with the Java pdf viewer
since it does not support hyperref
-->TD!



TODO list for the GUI release 3.0
---------------------------------

FF7:
that's all folks !


FF6:

sorry! needed to rename again 
check_ltl --> check_ltl_spec
and keep check_ltl for an LTL formula given as argument
--->DONE!!!

similarly:
check --> check_ctl and check_spec
check_why without argument -> check_why_spec
check_all --> check_all_spec
--->DONE!!!

FF5:

Replace "Specification" button by "Boolean temporal properties" and "Numerical temporal properties"
as in the manual 
--->DONE!!!

CTL specification window: 
should contain only the specification add delete
--->DONE!!!


CTL model checking window: 
should be called as in the manual "Checking CTL properties"
- nusmv(ctl) and nusmv_why(ctl) are renamed check(ctl) and check_why(ctl)
  they do not refer to the specification
  they should appear separately from the other commands
  that refer to the specification
- there should be a button for genCTL (listing CTL properties)
  different from add_genCTL (adding these CTL properties)
- save as and export as do not seem to work (it should be in .bc file only)
-reduce model list the rules but there seems to be nothing to copy them
 (selection works but no right click to copy)
- good focus when editing CTL formulae but 
  for & the focus should be after & not before
--->DONE!!!


LTL specification: follow the structure of the manual (revised)
to distinguish between:
- LTL(R) specification window (only add and delete)
- Checking LTL(R) properties window (check_ltl/old trace_checck, solve/old trace_analyze, landscape, robustness)
- Searching parameters
--->DONE!!!


LTL(R) checking:
- trace_check renamed check_ltl
--->DONE!!!


difference between "delete model" and "close model" unclear
--->DONE!!!

under cygwin from the gui "command biocham not found check your PATH"
--->NOT DONE!!!

saving a boolean simulation as png works in the calling directory
but saving an ODE or Stochastic simulation goes through
a different window asking for the format and then
proposes a different directory.
Better if the default directory could be the same
--->NOT DONE!!!



FF4: Good work! still to be improved:

Pb of focus permanently on the main gui window
(hides all other windows)
--->DONE!

"Online tutorial" should be replaced by "Biocham web page"
--->DONE!

The manual should be visible in html in a new window
like currently "online tutorial" 
(and if possible the pdf files in other windows also with the user app)
--->NOT DONE!
 


FF 3:
Aurelien --> implement satisfaction_degree and check the documentation manual.tex (landscape was not up to date)

added current_directory command

changed some commands keeping previous ones for compatibility until GUI update
several xshow_ commands to list_ commands 
find_pinvar to find_conservations
--->DONE!

even when doing nothing the CPU is 100% used when biocham_gui is running :-(
--->NOT DONE!



adding a rule: you should accept if a final . is typed
--->DONE!

the errors for the kinetics are visible in the launching window not in the GUI

no warning for Hill, an error not a warning for MM are raised in the GUI
I think Biocham we should either raise an error, or accept several reactants
taking the product of the reactants in the formulas,
but certainly not the first reactant in alphabetical order as is currently the case
--> Done accept with warning the product of the reactants for MM H and HN

export_prolog export_lotos do not seem to work in command line
strange . added in each line

biocham_gui cannot be launched from outside its directory
Administrateur@fages ~
$ biocham_gui
Unable to access jarfile /home/Administrateur/SVN/biocham/gui/biocham.jar

Administrateur@fages ~
$ cd SVN/biocham

Administrateur@fages ~/SVN/biocham
$ biocham_gui
works but doesn't find the root directory (asks me to enter manually)

FF 2:

new/open model --> import_ode import_sbml ...
--->DONE!
reaction/influence graph dot don't work under standard environment AFS
--->NOT DONE!


FF 1:

progression bar instead of messages ?
--->DONE!


First screen:
- perhaps not necessary, NEWS, OVERVIEW, tutorials could be elsewhere
- not obvious how to come back to this first screen
--->DONE!


Documentation (not tutorials)

- manual html pdf
- tutorial Dragana
--->DONE!


Parsing:
- MAPK with patterns does not parse



Simulations:
- the last opened model could be selected by default
--->DONE!


- add boolean simulation (time no steps no macros )
--->DONE!


- add command line completion with ^i (without introducing an indent)
--->DONE!


- ODE simulation autorange by default
--->DONE!



CTL spec:
- CTL spec editor does not handle ! as it should (parentheses are required although useless) --> pb biocham ?



- genCTL should be first level button
--->DONE!



Command line:
- the output should scroll automatically to the last line (focus)
- ^p should give previous compmands
- ^i do not insert the tab
- plot
--->DONE!


Rule graphical editor:
- no suffix for saving the drawing in xml sbgn ?
- better than putting everything in the same location,
  try writing (3?) reactions per line in the order you read the reactions ?
--->DONE! (except saving layout/opening layout)

- got:
